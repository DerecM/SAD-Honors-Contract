# SAD-Honors-Contract
Welcome, Jeff. 

Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to complete an honor's contract this semester. Attached to this Github repository is the requested MVC email checker application. Be sure to download all files so the program will work properly. 

To run the program, open the files in an IDE such as visual studio. Select "reactapp" and press F5 on your keyboard. Wait a few seconds for the website to load. Once it's done, you may test the website by entering input in the text field. The program will return a series of valid emails detected in the input box. 

The program runs as follows:
First, it will loop through each character until it finds an @. When it does, it will save the text before it into a potential email before sending it to the check username class.
